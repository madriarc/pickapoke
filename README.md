# Read Me for Pick A Poke

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Running:
To run, clone, go to the project directory, run
'npm start'
and open in [http://localhost:3000]

The idea of the App is to select a random Pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/
The App will always bring a new pokemon that hasn't been seen yet.
You can also add to a favourites list (and remove from favourites list as well).
